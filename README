Simply use 'make' to build the 'ab-splat' executable. Usage information will be
printed to the standard output stream when ab-splat is executed.
Vienna RNA (2.1.6) has been modified slightly, and a statically library version is 
included in the vienna folder as 'libRNA.a'. The modified file (LFold.c) has 
also been included, along with the header needed to use the library. Obviously, 
libRNA.a can be recompiled with a newer version of Vienna by dropping the LFold.c 
file in, and then running Vienna's makefile.
